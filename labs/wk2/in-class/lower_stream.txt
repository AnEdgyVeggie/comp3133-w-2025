people come to you when they need answers right? i guess that’s why i’m here, i need an answer. i want to know why she did it, and why i was stupid enough to never suspect her. i mean that stupid account basically ruined my life! i know that’s weird to say now that she’s dead, but everyone was talking about me, laughing at me, and making fun of me. ellie helped me pick myself up by day, and by night wrote about how hilarious it all was in her diary. am i even allowed to be mad at her? she was my best friend and i loved her so much, but how can i watch the entire school honour her memory and think she’s a saint when she was the reason most of the students were depressed? listen i don’t know how this works exactly… i’m not … you know the religious type. i don’t suppose you can just locate her quickly up there and ask why she did it and then pass the message on to me? (waits for a response) yeah… i didn’t think so.
